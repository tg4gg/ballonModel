# Ballon Model
MBSE MitX Week 2 project - Balloon modelling

Models the movement of a balloon filled with helium from the bottom
to the ceiling of a building, it uses the forward Euler approximation method.
If we set the flag 'refinedModel' it'll recalculate values for air pressure
in each step and will consider a meandering motion path for the balloon.

## What are the dependencies?
It uses numpy and matplotlib, if you're not not familiar with these packages 
you can download Anaconda which is available for MacOS, Linux and Windows.
